# Tauri Template

A [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app) desktop application template: a pnpm + Turborepo
monorepo with a React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS frontend, a Rust backend, and
the lint / format / type-check / test / release pipeline already wired up.

> ⚠️ **Opinionated template.** It follows our internal standards. Fork it, strip
> what you do not need, and make it yours.

## ✨ What is in the box

| Shell     | Tauri v2 — a Rust core plus the OS webview, no bundled browser                                     |
| Frontend  | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4                                                        |
| Workspace | pnpm workspaces with catalogs, Turborepo                                                           |
| Quality   | ESLint, Prettier (with Tailwind class sorting), Vitest, clippy, rustfmt                            |
| CI/CD     | GitHub Actions: checks on every PR, installers for macOS, Windows and Linux from semantic releases |

## 🚀 Getting started

Prerequisites: Node (see [.node-version](.node-version)), pnpm, and the
[Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) — Rust plus your
platform's build tools (WebView2 on Windows, Xcode command line tools on macOS,
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` and friends on Linux).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run setup   # one-time: renames the template to your project
pnpm dev         # the desktop app
```

`pnpm run setup` is a one-time step. Until it has run, `pnpm install` prints a
reminder and `git commit` is blocked. It finishes by deleting the `setup/`
folder, so the gate removes itself. It is skipped in CI, in this template repo
itself, and with `SKIP_SETUP_CHECK=1`.

### Everyday commands

| Command                                               | What it does                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                                            | Runs the app: Vite dev server plus the Rust backend, both hot-reloading |
| `pnpm dev:web`                                        | Frontend alone in a browser — no Rust toolchain needed                  |
| `pnpm build`                                          | Builds the frontend bundle                                              |
| `pnpm bundle`                                         | Builds installers for the current platform                              |
| `pnpm test`                                           | Vitest across the workspace                                             |
| `pnpm typecheck`                                      | `tsc --noEmit` across the workspace                                     |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix`                         | ESLint                                                                  |
| `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:fix`                     | Prettier                                                                |
| `pnpm rust:fmt` / `pnpm rust:lint` / `pnpm rust:test` | rustfmt, clippy, cargo test                                             |
| `pnpm fix:all`                                        | Format, lint and type-check in one go                                   |
| `pnpm gen:icons`                                      | Regenerates the icon set from `apps/desktop/app-icon.png`               |
| `pnpm gen:package`                                    | Scaffolds a new workspace package                                       |

Anything under `apps/` or `packages/` can also be targeted directly:
`pnpm --filter @internal/ui test`.

## 📁 Structure

```
apps/
└── desktop/            # the application
    ├── src/            # React frontend
    └── src-tauri/      # Rust backend, tauri.conf.json, capabilities, icons
packages/
├── tauri-api/          # typed wrappers around the Rust commands
├── ui/                 # shared React components and the theme
└── utils/              # framework-free helpers
tooling/
├── eslint/ prettier/ typescript/ vitest/   # shared configs
├── tailwind/           # globals.css: the theme, imported once by the app
└── vite/               # the Tauri-aware Vite config factory
```

Every package is private and consumed as TypeScript source, so there is no build
step between them — change a component and the app hot-reloads.

Read [apps/desktop/README.md](apps/desktop/README.md) for the app itself:
adding a command, a plugin or a second window.

## 🧭 Coming from Electron?

Tauri splits the same problem differently, and the template's layout follows its
split rather than Electron's.

| Electron                                  | Tauri                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main process (Node.js)                    | Rust core — `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src`                                              |
| Renderer process                          | An OS webview loading the Vite build — `apps/desktop/src`                             |
| Preload script + `contextBridge`          | Nothing. The frontend has no system access unless a command or a permission grants it |
| `ipcMain.handle` / `ipcRenderer.invoke`   | `#[tauri::command]` + `invoke`, wrapped in `@internal/tauri-api`                      |
| `nodeIntegration`, `sandbox`, allowlists  | `capabilities/*.json` — per-window permissions, checked in Rust                       |
| electron-builder                          | The Tauri bundler (`pnpm bundle`)                                                     |
| ~100 MB installer with a bundled Chromium | A few MB against the system webview                                                   |

The practical difference: there is no privileged JavaScript. Anything the UI
needs from the system is a Rust function you chose to expose, which is why the
`packages/tauri-api` boundary exists and why nothing else calls `invoke`.

## 🎨 Styling

Tailwind v4 is configured in CSS, not in a config file. The single entry point is
[tooling/tailwind/globals.css](tooling/tailwind/globals.css): it defines the
theme tokens, registers the workspace packages as sources, and is imported once
in `apps/desktop/src/main.tsx`.

Colors are CSS custom properties that the `.dark` class redefines, so components
use `bg-card` or `text-muted-foreground` and follow the theme automatically —
`dark:` variants are rarely needed. `ThemeProvider` from `@internal/ui` owns the
light / dark / system choice.

## 🤖 CI and releases

| Workflow                                                     | Trigger                        | Does                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)                           | push, pull request             | Lint, format, types and tests, plus rustfmt, clippy and `cargo test`   |
| [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)                     | manual, or called by a release | Builds installers on macOS (both architectures), Windows and Linux     |
| [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)                 | push to `main`                 | Uses conventional commits to version, tag and publish a GitHub release |
| [codeql-analysis.yml](.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) | push, PR, weekly               | CodeQL scan of the TypeScript sources                                  |

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) on `main`.
Pushing a `fix:` commit creates a patch release; `feat:` creates a minor
release; and a breaking-change footer creates a major release. The Release
workflow updates `apps/desktop/package.json`,
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and
`apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, then tags the version, creates a
GitHub release, builds the installers and attaches them.

For example:

```sh
git commit -m "feat: add saved workspaces"
git push origin main
```

The release is published automatically once its installers finish building.

## 🔄 In-app updates

The updater is wired up but switched off: the plugin is registered, the release
workflow signs its artifacts and publishes a `latest.json`, and the app checks
once at startup. None of it runs until you give it a signing key, so the
template releases fine as it is.

[docs/updater.md](docs/updater.md) has the setup — generating the key pair,
where the public and private halves go, and how to verify a release carries
what the updater needs.

Installers are still not OS code-signed or notarised, which is a separate
thing: see the Tauri [code signing guide](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/).
